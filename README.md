# webcam
Accessing your webcam via your browser used to involve a...pardon the profanity, a plugin. That's right. In order to connect to a webcam and gain access to its video stream, you had to rely on something primarily created in Flash or Silverlight. While that approach certainly worked for browsers that supported plug-ins, it didn't help for the increasing number of browsers that aim to be plugin-free. This inability to natively access the webcam without relying on 3rd party components was certainly a gap in the HTML development story. At least, that was the case until pretty recently.
